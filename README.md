GIFBOMB

GIFbomb is a web application built with javascript, express, and nodeJS using the GIPHY web API. The app makes calls to the GIPHY API with searches for 'kitten' gifs, 'puppy'gifs, random gifs, and/or the keyterm selected by the user.

GIFbomb was made as an assignment for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in 2015 by Mark Smukler.
